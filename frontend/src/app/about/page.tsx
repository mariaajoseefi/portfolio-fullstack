            Hello! I'm Majo, a software engineer with a passion for creating thoughtful designs and meaningful user experiences. With a background in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy building applications that are not only functional but also delightful to use.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, sketching in my notebook, or enjoying a good cup of coffee. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
